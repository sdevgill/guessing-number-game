# Guessing Game Number

## The Objective

Our objective is to build a simple game played in the console, where the user has to guess a secret number that is chosen at random. Upon making a guess, the user will receive a hint indicating if their guess is too small or too large. Below is an example of how the final product will play. User inputs are denoted with *asterisks*. All other text is produced by the computer.

```
Enter a max number: *20*
Enter a min number: *11*
I'm thinking of a number between 11 and 20...
Enter a guess: *15*
Too high.
Enter a guess: *11*
Too low.
Enter a guess: *13*
Too high.
Enter a guess: *12*
Correct!
YOU WON.
```
